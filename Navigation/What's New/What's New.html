        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">Google has recently published a new developer guideline on the Google Developers page. This document gives a good insight into how to create structured data with the help of JavaScript and how to implement it on the website, or rather how to do it properly so that it can bring benefits in Google search. In general, the guide describes three methods for dynamically adding structured data to a web site using JS: Google Tag Manager, сustom JS, and rendering on the server-side. Nowadays, the use of JavaScript is a must for creating a website with enhanced functionality. Thus, these tips will be especially valuable for web developers and SEO specialists.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px;">What’s New in DHTMLX Gantt Chart Version 7.0</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="2.JPG" alt="Image for the post" height="392px" width="696px" style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 100px;">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">This month, our development team has finally given a green light to the major release of DHTMLX Gantt. A new version 7.0 offers several important improvements that will come in handy for expanding the functionality of our Gantt in any project management app.</p><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">In addition to several important client-side updates such as merging several calendars, new configuration options for grid columns, and updated content security policy, the new DHTMLX Gantt component has also taken aboard a groundbreaking server-side Gantt module for Node.js.</p><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">This add-on will allow you to do some magic with our Gantt on the server-side in the Node.js environment. For instance, you will be able to keep Gantt chart tasks up to date with the help of auto-scheduling after receiving task updates from different sources. The module also makes it possible for numerous users to work with Gantt and introduce necessary alterations into its schedule simultaneously. Moreover, you will be able to perform calculations and analyze the schedule via your server code.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px;">Nextstrain Looks for JS Developers to Fight COVID-19</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="4.JPG" alt="Image for the post" height="392px" width="696px" style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 100px;">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">Nextstrain, an international nonprofit project focused on creating visualization instruments for monitoring and analyzing the development and spread of pathogenic germs, has urged JavaScript developers to give a helping hand in updating its interactive web app named Auspice.</p><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">Recently, this application has been widely used for illustrating the evolution and geographic distribution of COVID-19. Each week, the Auspice team issues situation reports using narratives on the extension of the coronavirus disease. This information allows virologists and other specialists to analyze and observe how the pathogen is changing.</p><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">The problem is that currently narratives can only make use of only one dataset and it significantly limits the amount of data covered in reports. That is why Nextstrain seeks help from JS developers in enhancing the narratives functionality i.e. enabling each narrative to use multiple datasets.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px;">Introducing Crank.js Framework</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="5.JPG" alt="Image for the post" height="392px" width="696px" style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 100px;">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 260px; font-size: large;">If you are looking for some new approach to building JSX-driven components, then you should certainly pay attention to Crank.js. This new framework can be considered as an alternative to major JSX libraries (such as React or Preact), allowing you to create JSX-based components with the help of functions, promises, and generators. Crank.js does not require the usage of hooks, classes, or proxies, thereby significantly simplifying the process of debugging. Thanks to the support of promises, Crank.js makes it possible to utilize async/await right in components, and race components to display fallback UIs.</p>
